# Image-Classification
Personal skin care assistant using deep learning

A mobile application used to identify skin disease using images captured from camera. 
App is built with Android+AI model with integrates through python pipeline concept. 
images from the android devices are transferred to AI model which classify the skin disease using image classification algorithm on cloud and sends responses to the classified disease names.

The net model was used by applying and transfer learning on the 7 skin diseases to creat a skin disease classification system on andriod application.
Proponents gathered a total of 3,406 images and it is considered as a imbalanced dataset because of the unequal number of images in its classes.
Using differnet sampling method and preprocessing of input data was explored to further improve the accuracy of the MobileNet.
Using an under sampling method and the default preprocessing of input data achieved an 84.28% accuracy.
